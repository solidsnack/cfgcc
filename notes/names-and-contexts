  For usernames and many other names, patterns are useless; for filenames,
  patterns are essential. If we want to specify that there are no JPEG files
  in a certain directory, we should be able to use `/<dir>/*.jpeg'.

  We need to be able to specify pattern resolution with respect to:

 .  The root of one or more tarballs sent with the YAML file.

 .  The installation root.

  These are _contexts_ and we need labels for them.
