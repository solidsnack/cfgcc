   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When installing files from a tarball, it is straightforward to decide what
    filenames are affected -- the filenames in the tarball. However, files
    that should be deleted are probably not in the tarball. How do we resolve
    the names of files to be deleted? We need a way for the user to express
    negative space in the filesystem (and also in the passwd db). It is good
    to allow globs in this scenario.

    We have considered name expansion to be a distinct phase from running the
    installation; we take the YAML file, gather up the rules and then open the
    tarball to resolve names. However, as soon as we want to talk about names
    that aren't in the tarball we see we are stuck.

    If we combine name resolution with execution than we have an auditing
    issue; we can't see what the script will do. However, if we try to really
    do it than we have to try to shell escape within the executable.
