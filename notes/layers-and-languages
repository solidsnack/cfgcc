  The configuration management system, even after parsing of the YAML is
  completely, works with a few different languages:

 .  A language of declarative specifications (there is a file here).

 .  A langauge of guarded actions (if this file is not here, create it).

 .  Raw shellscript (`test ! -f <the file> || touch <the file>').

  The guarded actions have the quality that, if we check the guard, run the
  action and check it again, the guard is satisfied. Guarded actions are
  made idempotent due to the guard.
