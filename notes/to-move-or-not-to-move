  If a user owns millions of files, renaming them is much better than removing
  them, adding a new user and chowning all their files. Similarly, moving a
  directory of MOVs is better than deleting them and reinstalling them
  elsewhere.

  However, we can't state "rename <x> to <y>" as an idempotent action. How
  does one test that one moved <x> to <y> as opposed to creating <y> from
  scratch? There is no way to disambugate the two cases on the testing side.

  A rename is more like a compiler hint; it doesn't say *what should be there*
  but rather *how to do it*. I am not sure how to even offer the possibility
  of hinting the compiler.
